Part 2b:

Question:

Just like how I implement part 1's condition I will do the same with this case as well where the user can either enter the slash before the character/word or after the character/word. For the before case the user will need to match it with a start tag and for after case the user won't have to do anything as this stand alone tag is valid by itself.
