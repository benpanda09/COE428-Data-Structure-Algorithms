mySort is a library created by the user. The code is an implementation of a sorting algorithm that sorts number in an ascending order. 

The sortMain is the main program that uses the mySort library created by the user. The way this program works is sorting numbers in an array in ascening order for example, an array containing the numbers: 2, 1, 5, 3, 9, the program will be able to sort it in this order: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9. However if an error were to occur after the sorting process the program will check what is wrong and output an error message informing the user that there is an error in the program. 

The cmdlineDemo code is there to show us how command line arugments work. In this case if you were to pass in any amount of aruments the program will yeild the arguments in varying formats like in hexadecimal form. 

The sortMain2 program is similar to the sortMain program with a couple altercations. These changes allows the program take in command line arugments and sort the arguments it took in rather than the random generated numbers. 

QUESTION:

the betterSort method/function can be implemented by storing the first and last variable in the temporary varibles then the sorting algorithm will compare each of the element/values in the array with the temporary variables and order them in ascending order.
