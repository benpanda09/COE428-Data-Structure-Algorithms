A finite state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model used to represent and control systems that can be in one of a finite number of states. It consists of a set of states, inputs, and transitions between states that are triggered by inputs. In this case the trigger the sequences of 1 and 0. For example the fsm below, the starting state for this machine is C if the user were to enter 1 the state the program will go State H and so on. The change command will swap out the state that your current state is going to and the garbage and delete command just deletes and take out the state machines that are not reachable due to the change command. 

FSMs can be used in many applications, including control systems, digital circuits, and software applications. They are often used in the design of compilers, parsers, and other computer programs. FSMs can be designed using a variety of methods, including state diagrams, state tables, and state transition matrices.

Everything in this lab went well and pretty sure all the commands withint this lab works.
